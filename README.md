# 🧪 Expo UI Playground

An **experimental playground** for exploring and showcasing [Expo UI](https://docs.expo.dev/ui/overview/) components with comprehensive examples and real-world implementations.

## 🎯 What's Inside

This playground demonstrates a complete **productivity app interface** built entirely with Expo UI Swift components, featuring:

### 📱 Core Components Showcase

- **Profile Management** with dynamic avatar and theme customization
- **Button Variants** - All 7 button styles (default, bordered, plain, glass, etc.)
- **Dashboard Metrics** with interactive gauges and sliders
- **Task Management** with filtering, completion tracking, and priority systems
- **Context Menus** with nested submenus, switches, and destructive actions
- **Date & Time Pickers** with multiple display styles and configurations
- **Settings Management** with disclosure groups and advanced controls

### 🏗️ Architecture Features

- **React Context State Management** using the new `use()` hook
- **TypeScript Integration** with comprehensive type definitions
- **Real-time Interactivity** - all components update dynamically
- **Realistic Data Flow** - meaningful interactions between components
- **Modular Component Structure** - well-organized and reusable sections

### 🎨 UI Components Demonstrated

- `Button` (7 variants)
- `Gauge` (6 types: circular, capacity, linear, etc.)
- `Slider` with real-time value updates
- `Switch` with various configurations
- `Picker` (segmented and menu variants)
- `ColorPicker` with opacity support
- `DateTimePicker` with multiple display modes
- `DisclosureGroup` for expandable content
- `ContextMenu` with nested submenus
- `ContentUnavailableView` for empty states
- `Section` and layout components (`VStack`, `HStack`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or: npm start (for native development)
   ```

3. **Open on your preferred platform**
   - iOS Simulator (recommended for full Expo UI support)
   - Android Emulator
   - Physical device with Expo Go

> The `@expo/ui` package bundles native-only views like `BottomSheet` that crash on web. A `patch-package` fix removes this export so the app runs in browsers.

> **Note**: Some Expo UI components require iOS 16+ and work best on iOS simulators or physical iOS devices.

## 🎮 Interactive Features

### Profile Section

- **Dynamic Avatar** with theme color customization
- **Profile Settings** with expandable disclosure groups
- **Size Controls** for profile image scaling

### Dashboard Metrics

- **6 Gauge Types** showcasing different visualization styles
- **Interactive Sliders** with real-time value updates
- **Action Buttons** for testing different states
- **Performance Tracking** with meaningful metrics

### Task Management

- **Real Task Data** with priorities, due dates, and descriptions
- **Interactive Filtering** (all, pending, completed)
- **Task Completion** with immediate UI updates
- **Priority Visualization** with color-coded indicators

### Context Menu System

- **Nested Submenus** up to 3 levels deep
- **Mixed Content** - buttons, switches, destructive actions
- **Real Actions** that affect app state
- **State Persistence** across interactions

### Date & Time Controls

- **Multiple Picker Styles** (compact, graphical, wheel)
- **Different Modes** (date, time, date+time)
- **Live Updates** showing current selections

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

- **State Management**: React Context with `use()` hook (React 19 feature)
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with interface definitions
- **Modular Architecture**: Separated concerns with dedicated sections
- **Real Data Flow**: Components interact with shared state
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient re-renders and state updates
